# PyBer_Analysis


## Purpose
The man purpose of this is to get the information provided by PyBer to analyze how to ride share app is being used in different city types. In addition to that, we are putting our visualization skills to the test by creating different graphs and tables to show data more efficiently.

## Results

We can see that most of the PyBer users are in Urban places. The total amount of fares for urban settings is $39,854.38 in comparison to the lowest (rural) who had $4,327.93. WHat I also found intersting is that although rural is the lowest in rides, fares and drivers, it is the hightest in average fare per ride at $34.62. That is almost $10 than the cheapest (urban, $24.53). This can be a reason for the user's lack of interest in PyBer rides. They might be more inclided to take local transportation like taxis, buses, or walking than paying such a high price.

Urban settings might like the convenience of being able to summon a car when public transportation is crowded or the weather is bad. Urban settings also see more night life which might incline the riders to chose PyBer over taking buses or driving personal cars. The low price is also very attractive when these times show up. 

Suburban places are in the middle. They might not have too much demand for drivers since their style of living isn't as demanding as an urban city, but still require a ride here and there. 

Taking a look at the chart below you can see tha the fares drop after April for urban cities. This could be affected by weather and people wanting to walk rather than take a car.

## Summary
This all means that there needs to be a way to make ridesharing more attractive to rural areas. Perhaps lowering the prices to compete with other modes of transportation would be a good idea. Rises prices in urban settings could also be a possible senario to try. They are using it the most, therefore might be more inclided to keep using it because they have a higher need for it - especially in colder months. Further reaserch might have to be conducted to see if there is more apps like Pyber in these cities who might lower/ raise their prices to compete with us.
